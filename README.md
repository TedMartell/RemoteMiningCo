## 🧠 Background & Vision

I've always loved the semi-idle playstyle of mining games, but they often feel shallow. Remote Mining Co. aims to fix that by introducing:

- 🛠️ A robust crafting and upgrade system  
- 💤 Idle-game elements for a chill experience  
- 🎨 A cohesive visual style and intuitive UI
