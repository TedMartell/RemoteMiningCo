# Remote Mining Co.

## Short Description

Game is built on the Contruct 3 engine using JavaScript. The game itself is based on classic mining game called Motherload and is a 2D mining game.

## Background

I have always enjoyed the semi-idle playstyle of mining games in general. But I usually feel they lack some depth. 
The goal of my mining game is to provide more depth through a crafting and upgrades system, as well as providing multiple levels. 
I have also brought in more "Idle-Game" elemets to make the experience more relaxing. 

The game itself is still under progress on many fronts, however very playable. The next short term goal is to get some rough balancing done and get a server running to share a demo of the game on.
