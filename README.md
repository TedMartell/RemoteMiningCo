# Remote Mining Co.

## Short Description

2D Mining game built using the Construct 3 engine (JavaScript). The game is currently not finnished. The goal is to be the most in depth mining game on the market 

## Background

I have always enjoyed the semi-idle playstyle of mining games in general. But I usually feel they lack some depth. 
The goal of my mining game is to provide more depth through a crafting and upgrades system, as well as providing multiple levels. 
I have also brought in more "Idle-Game" elemets to make the experience more relaxing. 

## WHERE TO GET

Currently there is a free demo available on Steam via the link:

The full game will be released on 9.8.2025!
