# Remote Mining Co.
Game called Remote Mining co. 

Game is built on the Contruct 3 engine using JavaScript.

The game itself is based on classic mining game called Motherload. Playing it as a kid I did feel however the original game lacked some depth, and have later found that similar mining game has had the same issue. 
The goal of my mining game is to provide more depth through a crafting and upgrades system, as well as providing multiple levels. 

The game itself is still under progress on many fronts, however very playable. The next short term goal is to get some rough balancing done and get a server running to share a demo of the game on.
